we've got a small collection of papers from one student who is interested in learning more about the patterns that can be re-used in future writing 

We can perform the analysis on these papers while taking into account the course materials from the coordinator 

so we should first review the materials and identify the relevant instructions and insights about how to organize the paper 

then we should just analyze one paper to gain insights on organization; after that we can apply the same analysis to other papers

we have a goal plan template that is relevant 

we also have session 1 student handout 
the file is not very clean - we've got some screenshots in a word doc - we need to turn them into machine-readable format 




/Users/simonwang/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-HongKongBaptistUniversity/GTD/Areas/Teaching/Courses/MCCP 6020/PhDagentSpring2026/writing/materials/Session 1_Handout_STUDENT version_LLM_Formatted.md this is the md version 
but this is somewhat different from the word doc version some images are missing 
so we need to compare the two - ok I just updated the doc above and add some pictures and try to turn them into machine readable format 


more importantly we want to review the goals and see how we can help students achieve these goals
