**Cursor**

This is a planning document with instructions to:

1. **Review** the presentation 1 materials and the `ideaPlan.md`
2. **Create** a `plan4pre1.md` outlining what students do before, during, and after class
3. **Set up** a `pre1work` folder with specific files (`genOutline.md`, `feedback.md`, etc.)
4. **Account for** the HTML slides rationale from `whyHTMLslides.md`
5. **Create** a `process.log` to document everything in real time

This is a multi-step task with several deliverables. Let me start by reading all the referenced materials, then I'll proceed step by step. First, let me gather context.

Now let me also read the Session 4 handouts for additional context on presentation skills.

I've now reviewed all the materials. Let me create a task plan and start executing.

**Summary of what I gathered:**
- **Presentation 1** is an 8-minute presentation on an empirical journal article, for a non-specialist audience (20% weighting)
- Four required content areas: introduction, key findings, significance, impact on own research
- Assessed on: Content/Structure/Interaction, Delivery/Body Language/Timing, Visual Aids, Language Range/Accuracy
- No reading from scripts; note cards allowed
- Peer review is required
- HTML slides are preferred over PowerPoint (AI-generated, precise, editable, web-based)
- The `ideaPlan.md` outlines a workflow: AI generates outline → student reviews → AI generates HTML slides → practice delivery

Starting with the process log and then the plan. Let me create both the `process.log` and `plan4pre1.md` now.

Now creating `plan4pre1.md`.

Now creating the `pre1work` folder and its files.

All tasks are complete. Here's a summary of everything that was created:

---

**Files created:**

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `pre1/teachingAssessment/process.log` | Real-time documentation of all steps taken |
| `pre1/teachingAssessment/plan4pre1.md` | Master plan covering before/during/after class activities for speakers and reviewers, the `pre1work` folder workflow, and the rationale for HTML slides |
| `pre1/teachingAssessment/pre1work/genOutline.md` | AI agent instructions to read the paper + requirements and generate a presentation outline with rubric-aligned presenter notes + an HTML slide plan |
| `pre1/teachingAssessment/pre1work/feedback.md` | Structured template for students to provide feedback on the AI-generated outline (with checkboxes and sections for content accuracy, accessibility, structure, visual preferences, and specific changes) |
| `pre1/teachingAssessment/pre1work/papers/` | Folder for students to place their chosen journal article |
| `pre1/teachingAssessment/pre1work/sample_slides/` | Folder for sample HTML presentation slides |

**Key design decisions in `plan4pre1.md`:**
- Organized as **Before Class / In Class / After Class** with separate **Speaker** and **Reviewer** roles
- Includes the full workflow: paper → AI outline → student feedback → AI revision → HTML slides → practice → present
- Incorporates the HTML slides rationale from `whyHTMLslides.md`
- References all rubric criteria so students know exactly what they're assessed on

Would you like me to adjust anything in these files, or shall we proceed with something else?

**Cursor**

There are untracked files to commit. Let me stage the new files we created and push.

Staging looks good — 17 new files including the plan, pre1work folder, and supporting materials. Committing and pushing now.

Done. All 17 new files have been committed and pushed to `https://github.com/tesolchina/mccpSpring2026` on the `main` branch. The commit includes:

- `plan4pre1.md` — the master plan for speakers and reviewers
- `pre1work/` folder — with `genOutline.md`, `feedback.md`, and subfolders for papers and sample slides
- Assessment rubrics for pre1, pre2, pre3
- `whyHTMLslides.md` and `process.log`

mccpSpring2026/pre1/teachingAssessment/pre1workDemo/genOutline.md

---

**Cursor**

This is the `genOutline.md` in the `pre1workDemo/` folder — the same AI agent instructions template. It looks like you have a demo setup with sample slides already added. Would you like me to **execute these instructions** — i.e., read the paper in `pre1workDemo/papers/`, review the assessment requirements, and generate the presentation outline and HTML slide plan?

Let me first check what's available in the demo folder.

The demo folder has:
- `papers/KV_flow_paper_full.html` — the journal article to present
- `genOutline.md` — the instructions (currently open)
- `feedback.md` — for student feedback
- `sample_slides/` — empty (the pptx files you viewed may not be saved there yet)

Shall I **execute the genOutline.md instructions** now — read the paper, generate the presentation outline, and create an HTML slide plan? Just confirm and I'll get started.

Let me start by reading the paper and the sample slides for reference.

The paper is large (993 lines of HTML). Let me read it in sections.

Let me continue reading the key sections of the paper — the design, evaluation results, and conclusion.

Now let me find the conclusion section.

I now have a thorough understanding of the paper. Let me generate the presentation outline and slide plan.

**Status: Paper fully read.** The paper is "KVFlow: Efficient Prefix Caching for Accelerating LLM-Based Multi-Agent Workflows" by Pan et al. (UCSD/AWS, 2025). It proposes a smarter memory management system for AI multi-agent workflows, achieving up to 1.83x-2.19x speedups.

Now generating the outline and slide plan.

Outline generated. Now creating the HTML slide plan.

Now let me update the process log.

All tasks complete. Here's a summary of what was generated:

---

**Files created in `pre1workDemo/`:**

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `outline_generated.md` | Full 8-minute presentation outline with 6 sections, analogies for non-specialists, presenter notes per section, timing guide, and rubric alignment checklist |
| `slide_plan.md` | Detailed plan for 10 HTML slides with content, visual elements, design specs, and technical implementation details |

**Key design choices in the outline:**

- **Analogies used:** Team of specialists (agents), hospital triage (eviction priority), relay runner (prefetching)
- **3 key findings presented:** Agent Step Graph, workflow-aware eviction (1.83x speedup), proactive prefetching (2.19x speedup)
- **Writing skills highlighted:** Clear problem framing, visual storytelling, honest evaluation
- **Direct quote from paper** included for evidence

**Next step** in the workflow: The student reviews `outline_generated.md`, writes feedback in `feedback.md`, and then the AI agent revises the outline and generates the actual HTML slide deck. Would you like me to proceed to generating the HTML slides now, or would you like to review and provide feedback first?

This is a substantial multi-step task. Let me break it down and get started.

Let me start by reading the pptx files and the writing materials in parallel.

The pptx files can't be read directly — I'll need to convert them using Python. Let me also read the key writing materials in parallel.

Good, python-pptx is installed. Let me now convert the pptx files and read more writing materials.

Now let me convert both pptx files and also read more writing materials in parallel.

Good, the files exist. The path issue was that I was already inside the repo directory. Let me convert both pptx files now.

Now let me extract style details from both presentations and create `style.md`.

Now I have all the style data. Let me create the `style.md` and then move on to the other tasks. Given the scope, let me work on multiple items together.

**Progress: Step 1 done** (pptx → md + style.md). Now working on Step 2 — reading writing materials to strengthen the outline's writing section. Let me check the key writing resources.

Now I have enough context about the writing materials. The key takeaway for strengthening the outline is the **CARS model** (Creating a Research Space), the **rhetorical moves** framework, the **writing strategies** (synthesis, gap identification, evaluative language), and the **academic phrasebank**. Let me now create the `updatedOutline.md` with an enriched Section 4 on writing.

**Progress: Steps 1-2 done.** Now creating the updated slide plan and then the HTML slides. Let me create both together to save time.

**Progress: Steps 1-3 done.** Now building the HTML slides — this is the big deliverable.

**Progress: Steps 1-4 done.** Now committing and pushing.

Now let me check if GitHub Pages is already enabled and set it up if needed.

GitHub Pages is already enabled, serving from `main` branch root. The site is building now.

All tasks complete. Here's the summary:

---

**All 6 tasks done.** Here are the deliverables:

**Cursor**

Let me review the current slides and rubrics to plan the revisions.

Now building `slidesV2.html`. This is a significant rewrite with 6 key changes: wider margins, more content (expanding to ~14 slides for 8 minutes), slide numbers, rubric labels, transition cues, and browser-editable functionality with cache/download.

`slidesV2.html` is created. Let me now commit and push to GitHub.

All done. Here's a summary of the changes in `slidesV2.html`:

**1. Wider margins** — Side padding increased from `8vw` to `15vw`, preventing content from stretching edge-to-edge on 16:9 screens.

**2. More content for 8 minutes** — Expanded from 10 to 12 slides:
- Added a **Roadmap slide** (Slide 2) outlining the 4 assessment sections
- Expanded the **Problem slide** with a two-column comparison (LRU vs KVFlow gap)
- Split **Writing Lessons** into two slides: Slide 10 (CARS Model deep-dive) and Slide 11 (Visual Storytelling, Honest Evaluation, Effective Synthesis)
- Added an **Impact on Research Design** slide (Slide 9) with concrete reflections and a direct quote

**3. Slide numbers** — Every slide shows its number in the top-right corner.

**4. Rubric labels** — Color-coded tags like `CONTENT & STRUCTURE`, `KEY FINDINGS`, `SIGNIFICANCE`, `WRITING SKILLS`, `EVIDENCE`, `NON-SPECIALIST`, and `DELIVERY` appear throughout, referencing the assessment rubric criteria.

**5. Transitional cues** — Each content slide ends with an italicized transition line (e.g., *"Now let me explain how KVFlow solves this problem..."*) to improve flow between slides.

**6. Editable in browser** — Press **T** to show/hide the toolbar, **E** to toggle edit mode. In edit mode, all text is contenteditable. The toolbar offers:
- **Save to Cache** — stores the current HTML in localStorage
- **Load from Cache** — restores a previous version
- **Download HTML** — exports the current state as a new `.html` file
- **Clear Cache** — removes saved data

as you can see 
the font size is not big enough
there is still a lot of empty space wasted 
create slideV3.html to fix these issues

---

**Cursor**

I can see the issue clearly — the text is small and the content is crammed into the top half with the bottom half empty. Let me fix both by increasing font sizes and better distributing content vertically.

The core problems: `15vw` side padding is too much, all font sizes use small `clamp()` max values, and `justify-content: center` clusters small content in the middle. I'll fix all of this — bigger fonts, moderate margins, and better vertical distribution.

Now let me commit and push.

Done. Here's what changed in `slidesV3.html` vs V2:

**Font sizes — increased ~30-40% across the board:**
| Element | V2 | V3 |
|---|---|---|
| Slide title | `clamp(1.8rem, 3.2vw, 2.8rem)` | `clamp(2.4rem, 4.2vw, 3.6rem)` |
| Body text / bullets | `clamp(0.95rem, 1.3vw, 1.15rem)` | `clamp(1.25rem, 1.8vw, 1.55rem)` |
| Highlight boxes | `clamp(0.88rem, 1.15vw, 1.05rem)` | `clamp(1.15rem, 1.6vw, 1.4rem)` |
| Transition cues | `clamp(0.8rem, 1vw, 0.9rem)` | `clamp(1.05rem, 1.4vw, 1.25rem)` |
| Captions | `clamp(0.8rem, 1vw, 0.9rem)` | `clamp(1rem, 1.3vw, 1.15rem)` |

**Space utilization:**
- Side padding reduced from `15vw` to `10vw` — reclaims ~10% width on each side
- Slide number moved to bottom-right (no longer wastes top margin)
- Agent nodes, timeline bars, bridge diagrams all scaled up proportionally
- Increased margins between content blocks for better vertical distribution

v3 is better now 
we need a genHTMLguide.md to reflect the principles 
place it in both mccpSpring2026/pre1/teachingAssessment/pre1work mccpSpring2026/pre1/teachingAssessment/pre1workDemo 





---

**Cursor**

Done. `genHTMLguide.md` has been created and placed in both locations. It covers 12 principles distilled from the V1→V3 iteration:

1. **Layout & Spacing** — `10vw` side padding, content should fill 70-80% of vertical space
2. **Font Sizes** — full table of minimum sizes with `clamp()` values (the biggest lesson from V2→V3)
3. **Slide Numbers** — bottom-right, light color
4. **Rubric Labels** — color-coded tags referencing assessment criteria
5. **Transitional Cues** — italicized lines at slide bottoms previewing what's next
6. **Content Volume** — 10-12 slides for 8 minutes, ~40-50 seconds each
7. **CSS-Only Diagrams** — agent nodes, timelines, bar charts, grids
8. **Color System** — CSS custom properties for consistency
9. **Self-Contained HTML** — single file, no frameworks, only Google Fonts external
10. **Navigation** — keyboard + mouse + progress bar
11. **Editable Mode** — contenteditable toggle, localStorage save, download as HTML
12. **Pre-Delivery Checklist** — verification steps before finalizing
