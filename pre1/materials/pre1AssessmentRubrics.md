## Oral Presentation Assessment 1 – Research Story-telling by Experienced Writers

**Date:** Sessions 5 & 6
**Weighting:** 20%

---

### INSTRUCTIONS

You will give an **8-minute presentation** on an empirical journal article in your field to a non-specialist audience and explain how experienced writers strategically tell their research stories in writing. You should:

1. Give a brief introduction to the article
2. Briefly explain the key findings
3. Highlight the significance of the research
4. Elucidate how this article may impact your own research design and what good writing skills you have learned from this article, with convincing evidence taken from the article

Your presentation needs to be **well-structured**, and the content should be intelligible to lay people who have no/little knowledge of your field. Hence, highly technical terms should be avoided. Visual aids, such as PowerPoint slides, are required. Please refer to Session 4 handouts for details about academic presentation skills and strategies for explaining disciplinary concepts and knowledge to a non-specialist audience.

You should upload the presentation slides to a folder shared by the class lecturer at least **two hours before the assessment**.

---

**NOTE:**

- You will need to evaluate two to four of your classmates’ presentations and provide peer feedback using a peer evaluation form. Your lecturer will tell you about the arrangements.
- The reviewers should:
  1. Raise questions during the Q&A session
  2. Complete the evaluation forms
