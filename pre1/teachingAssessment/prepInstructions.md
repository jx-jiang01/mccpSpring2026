create a copy of this file to mccpSpring2026/pre1/materials
review what the teacher did 
then assuming the student has cloned mccpSpring2026/pre1

create a pre1instructions.html that can be posted to moodle 

prepare a timeline for a three hour session 

expect students to do some prep in advance and update their forked version of the repo https://github.com/tesolchina/mccpSpring2026/tree/main/pre1 and send a reply to the forum 

then the first hour would be for them to prepare a bit more and compare notes 

second hour is for each student to present for just 3 minutes to get feedback on body lanaguage, interaction and eye contact 

perform a web search and create deliveryTips.md (with articles titles, summary, clickable links on how to engage a live audience in an academic conference); then create a deliveryTips.html in a gamified, visually appealing web page based on the md file, publish the file using github pages and return a URL 

commit and push everything to github
