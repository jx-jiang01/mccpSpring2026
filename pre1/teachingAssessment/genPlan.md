review the materials in the folder above to understand the requirement of presentation 1 
then review my idea of doing it in the section I teach mccpSpring2026/pre1/teachingAssessment/ideaPlan.md
then we can create a plan4pre1.md 
in the doc we outline what students need to prepare in advance; what they will do in class and what they will do after class as a speaker and as a reviewer 

we also need to set up a new folder pre1work 
in the folder there should be a place for sharing the paper to present and some sample presentation slides in pptx or google slides links
then a genOutline.md which would ask AI agent to review the requirement and generate an outline as well as a plan on generating slides in html - the outline should include some explanation notes on how to present to meet the rubrics expectations 
then a feedback.md with place holders; speaker should write some feedback on the outline generated
based on the feedback.md the AI agent will then revise the outline and generate an html file as visual aid (this slides will be assessed as well) 

also take into account mccpSpring2026/pre2/materials/whyHTMLslides.md
to update plan4pre1.md with an explanation of what students would do with the folder pre1work 

create a process.log to document everything being done in real time
