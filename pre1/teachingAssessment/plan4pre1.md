# Plan for Presentation 1 — Research Story-telling by Experienced Writers

## Overview

This plan outlines how students prepare for, deliver, and follow up on **Oral Presentation Assessment 1** (8 minutes, 20% weighting). The presentation is on an empirical journal article in the student's field, delivered to a non-specialist audience. Students work with an AI agent to generate an outline and HTML visual aids, then practice and refine their delivery.

## Assessment Requirements (Summary)

Presenters must:
1. Give a brief **introduction** to the article
2. Briefly explain the **key findings**
3. Highlight the **significance** of the research
4. Elucidate how the article may **impact their own research design** and what **good writing skills** they have learned, with **convincing evidence** from the article

**Key constraints:**
- Content must be intelligible to **non-specialist** audience (avoid technical jargon)
- Presentation must be **well-structured** with clear transitions
- **No reading from scripts** (note cards with key points are permitted)
- **Visual aids** (slides) are required
- Slides must be uploaded **at least 2 hours before** the assessment

**Rubric criteria (total: 40 marks):**
| Criteria | Focus Areas |
|---|---|
| Content, Structure & Effective Interaction | Audience-appropriate content, reflection integrated into analysis, logical flow, transition statements, Q&A answers, peer evaluation quality |
| Delivery, Body Language & Timing | Clarity, intonation/volume/stress, eye contact/posture/gestures, no script-reading, timing |
| Use of Visual Aids | Design quality, effective supplementing of speech |
| Language Range & Accuracy | Communicative effectiveness, grammatical accuracy |

## Before Class (Preparation Phase)

### As a Speaker

1. **Select your paper**
   - Choose an empirical journal article in your field (machine-readable format preferred: PDF or accessible text)
   - Place a copy in the `pre1work/papers/` folder

2. **Work with the AI Agent to generate an outline**
   - Follow the instructions in `pre1work/genOutline.md`
   - The AI agent will review the assessment requirements and your paper, then generate:
     - A **presentation outline** (markdown) covering the 4 required sections in ~8 minutes
     - **Presenter notes** with tips on how to meet each rubric criterion
     - A **plan for generating HTML slides** as visual aids
   - The generated outline will be saved in your `pre1work/` folder

3. **Review the AI-generated outline and provide feedback**
   - Carefully read the outline generated by the AI agent
   - Write your feedback in `pre1work/feedback.md` — consider:
     - Is the content accurate to your paper?
     - Is the language accessible to non-specialists?
     - Are there sections that need more/less detail?
     - Do you want specific visual elements on slides?
     - Are there key quotes or evidence from the paper you want highlighted?

4. **AI generates revised outline and HTML slides**
   - Based on your `feedback.md`, the AI agent will:
     - Revise the presentation outline
     - Generate an **HTML slide deck** as your visual aid
   - The HTML slides can be viewed in any browser and published via GitHub Pages

5. **Practice delivery**
   - Use the outline as a guide — do **not** write a full script
   - Practice speaking from key points on slides
   - Voice-record your practice (use otter.ai or upload audio) and review
   - Focus on: body language, eye contact, pacing, timing (~8 minutes)
   - Aim for natural delivery with emphasis on content words

### As a Reviewer

1. **Review the assessment rubric** in `pre1/materials/pre1AssessmentRubrics.md`
2. **Prepare to evaluate** 2–4 classmates' presentations
3. **Prepare thoughtful questions** for the Q&A session
4. Consider using AI assistance to help formulate constructive feedback

## In Class (Week 6 Meeting — Practice Session)

### Activities

1. **AI-assisted outline generation** (if not completed beforehand)
   - Students who haven't yet generated their outline can do so in class
   - Review and provide feedback on the generated outline

2. **3-minute delivery practice**
   - Each student delivers a short segment of their presentation (~3 minutes)
   - Focus areas: **delivery, body language, pace** (not content completeness)
   - Practice in a face-to-face setting
   - Voice-record the practice for later self-review

3. **Peer feedback on delivery**
   - After each practice segment, peers give brief oral feedback on:
     - Eye contact and posture
     - Volume and clarity
     - Pace and use of pauses
     - Whether the speaker reads from notes vs. speaks naturally

4. **Review and refine HTML slides**
   - Check slide design and readability
   - Make final adjustments via AI or direct HTML editing

---

## After Class (Refinement & Submission Phase)

### As a Speaker

1. **Continue practicing at home**
   - Deliver the full 8-minute presentation multiple times
   - **Important:** Do NOT write a full script and read from it
   - Record a video presentation for self-analysis
   - Check timing — aim for exactly 8 minutes
   - Refine transitions and signaling language (see Session 4 materials for useful phrases)

2. **Finalize slides**
   - Ensure HTML slides are polished and support (not duplicate) your speech
   - Upload slides at least **2 hours before** the assessment session

3. **Prepare for Q&A**
   - Anticipate likely questions about your paper and research
   - Practice responding concisely and confidently

### As a Reviewer

1. **Write peer feedback with AI assistance**
   - Use the rubric criteria to evaluate assigned classmates' presentations
   - Work with AI to help articulate clear, constructive feedback
   - Complete the peer evaluation forms
2. **Raise questions during Q&A**
   - Ask substantive questions that show engagement with the presenter's topic

## The `pre1work` Folder — What Students Do

The `pre1work/` folder is your personal workspace for preparing the presentation with AI assistance. Here's what each file/subfolder is for:

| Item | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `papers/` | Upload your chosen empirical journal article here (PDF or text). This is the input for the AI agent. |
| `sample_slides/` | Contains sample HTML presentation slides for reference. Study these to understand the format and design possibilities. |
| `genOutline.md` | **Start here.** This file contains instructions for the AI agent. When you run it, the AI will read your paper and the assessment requirements, then generate a presentation outline (markdown) and a plan for creating HTML slides. The outline includes presenter notes on how to meet each rubric criterion. |
| `feedback.md` | After reviewing the AI-generated outline, write your feedback here. Be specific — tell the AI what to change, add, or remove. The AI will then revise the outline and generate your HTML visual aid slides. |

### Workflow Summary

```
Paper (in papers/) 
   → AI reads paper + requirements (genOutline.md)
   → AI generates outline + slide plan
   → Student reviews and writes feedback (feedback.md)
   → AI revises outline + generates HTML slides
   → Student practices delivery (no scripts!)
   → Present in assessment session
```

## Why HTML Slides?

We encourage using **HTML** as the format for presentation slides instead of PowerPoint. Key advantages:

- **AI precision** — AI can generate HTML code more precisely than creating images or PowerPoint files directly
- **Web-based convenience** — HTML slides can be presented as a web page without relying on proprietary tools like PowerPoint
- **Customizable templates** — We can send sample slides to AI to generate a variety of layouts and formats
- **Browser-editable** — AI can generate editable HTML that students can modify directly in a browser

HTML slides can also be published via **GitHub Pages**, making them easily shareable and accessible from any device.

## Key Reminders

- **Do not read from scripts** — this will result in a failing grade
- **Use note cards** with key points only
- **Practice speaking from your slides** — slides should support, not replace, your speech
- **Focus on non-specialist audience** — avoid jargon, use metaphors/visuals/examples to explain technical concepts
- **Time management** — practice to stay within 8 minutes
- **Body language matters** — eye contact, gestures, posture, confident stance
- **Peer review is part of the assessment** — take reviewing seriously
