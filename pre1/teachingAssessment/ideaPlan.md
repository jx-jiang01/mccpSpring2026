We have our presentation guidelines and rubrics in github

The input would be one paper that is machine readable: each student has already shared a paper; you can also select a different one 
Given the instructions- to deliver a 8-minute presentation, we need to prepare some slides; let’s use a new way of preparing slides- ask AI to write html 

Why html for slides, instead of PowerPoint?  

============

Contents also matter 

We need good outlines from the paper; the outlines should be just markdown files- we can prepare slides later 

A key skill is to talk with some points on the slides, instead of reading scripts  

One important practice is to voice record your practice and transcribe it; we can use otter.ai; or we can also just upload the audio files 

=============

So in our week 6 meeting, what do we do? 

First we ask AI agent to generate a md file to outline the presentation (8 minutes) as well as a plan to generate slides in html 
Students should review it and write a feedback.md file 
Based on the feedback, AI would generate an html slide (and publish it using GitHub pages) 

Then we’ll practice a bit on delivery, body language and timing- let’s do a 3 minute practice; we mainly focus on delivery and body language and pace; we’ll voice record it but in a face to face setting 


Then we practice more at home - important not to write full scripts and read; deliver a video presentation (we can then analyze it) 

Working with AI is key; so peer reviewers should write some feedback with AI assistance
