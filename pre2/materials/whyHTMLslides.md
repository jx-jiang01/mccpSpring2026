We encourage students taking the course to explore the use of HTML as new format of presentation slides. They key advantages of html for slides include 
- the codes can be generated by AI in a morep precise way than generating images directly 
- the html can be presented as web page that is more convenient than relying on proprietory tools such as PowerPoint 
- we can send sample slides to AI to generate a variety of layout and formats 
- we can also ask AI to generate editable html that can be edited on a browser
