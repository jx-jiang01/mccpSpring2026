Introducing Your Research

Introducing your research effectively is a critical skill for any researcher. A well-crafted introduction sets the stage for your work, helping your audience understand the significance of your study, how it fits into existing knowledge, and why it matters. Whether you are writing the introduction section of a manuscript or presenting your research verbally, a clear and compelling introduction engages your audience and establishes your credibility. To make your introduction effective, it is important to provide context, articulate your research problem clearly, and highlight the contribution your work makes to your field. Mastering this skill not only strengthens your communication but also ensures your research makes a lasting impact.

Task 2

Functions, Key Component and Language Features of an ‘INTRODUCTION’

This task aims to check your prior knowledge about writing an effective introduction of a thesis/journal article in your discipline. Get a partner and discuss the ‘functions’, ‘key components’, ‘structure’ and the ‘language features’ of the introduction of a thesis/journal article in your discipline. Put your ideas in the space provided in the table below.

If your partner is from a different discipline, find out the possible variations across disciplines.

| Key Components and Structure                                                |                                                    |
| Language Features (e.g. tenses, voices, use of technical terms or keywords) |                                                    |

Questions for further discussion:

1. What are the possible disciplinary variations in the content (e.g. the key components), structure (e.g. length, number of moves), and language features (e.g. tenses, active vs passive voice, use of technical jargon) of the introduction of a thesis/journal article?
2. Are there any possible differences between the introduction of a thesis and of a journal article in your own discipline?

INTRODUCTION of a Thesis/Journal Article

A good INTRODUCTION should lead the reader from a general research issue or problem to your specific area of research. It puts your research question in context by explaining the significance of the research being conducted. It should also lay out a roadmap for the rest of the thesis/journal article.  The main purposes of an introduction are to:

* draw your readers in (introduces the topic)
* provide background information (briefly mentions some key previous studies)
* convince readers that your work is worth reading (highlight the potential contributions of your work)
* give direction to the remainder of the thesis/journal article (give an outline)

The Creating a Research Space (CARS) model, which highlights the key rhetorical moves (organizational patterns) in the introduction of a research paper/thesis, was developed by John Swales (1990) based on his analysis of journal articles representing a variety of discipline-based writing. In this model, there are three main moves:

| Rhetorical Moves                                 | Writing Actions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Move 1: Establishing a Territory [the situation] | 1. Describe the research problem and provide evidence to support why the topic is important to study.1. Explain the current state of knowledge, consensus, practice or description of phenomena.3. Synthesise the key prior research that further supports the need to study the research problem; this is different from a literature review in a way that only the key previous studies which have touched upon but not fully addressed the topic are included. |
| Move 2: Establishing a Niche [the problem]       | 1. Introduce an opposing viewpoint/perspective to the current state of knowledge; or1. Develop the research problem around a gap/an understudied area of the literature; or3. Present key questions about the consequences of gaps in prior research that will be addressed by your study; or3. Extend prior research to expand upon or clarify a research problem.                                                                                               |
| Move 3: Occupying the Niche [the solution]       | 1.``Explain clearly the objectives of your study.1. Present a brief summary of the key findings of your study.3. Indicate how the remainder of the paper is organized.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Claiming Centrality of Your Research Topic

Research articles and thesis introductions always begin with centrality statements because they help ‘establish the general territory’ [Move 1 in the CARS model] of the research topic. A centrality statement basically makes a general claim that your research topic area is of central interest or importance in the field, or sometimes in the world at large. These claims have four main features:

1. Characterised by the use of evaluative adjectivese.g. valuable, central, major, important
2. Referring to the impacts and a growing awareness of a probleme.g. increasingly, growing, a classic problem
3. Showing the currency of the topice.g. current, recent, recently
4. Using an inversion patterne.g. Particularly noteworthy/significant is that…, Of great/common concern is that…
5. Stated in present/present perfect tense

Some examples of centrality statements:

* Recently, there has been a wide interest in…
* The study of…has become an important aspect of…
* The relationship between…has been studied by many researchers in the field.

Task 3

Task 6

Planning for the Introduction of Your Research

Now think about the introduction of your own research. Use the space below to make notes. After that, present your ideas to a classmate and explain why you have such a plan.

1. What are the key components in the introduction of your own research?
2. What is the organisation pattern of the introduction? What are the moves? Why do you organize the ideas in this way?

Task 7

Introducing Your Research Verbally

Postgraduate students have many opportunities to introduce their research verbally to specialist or non-specialist audiences in different contexts e.g. academic conferences, candidature confirmation seminars, oral defences (viva), departmental seminars, round-table discussions, lab meetings with thesis supervisors and fellow research postgraduate students, 3-minute thesis competitions. Therefore, it is important for you to be able to verbally introduce your research to others in a concise and organised way.

When introducing your research to others, you need to consider the audience (Is s/he a specialist or non-specialist in your field? What does s/he want to know about your research?), purpose (Is the purpose of the speech to inform/persuade/inspire?), and the structure (How many sections are there? How can you help the audience follow the logical flow of ideas more easily?) of your speech.

At the end of this course, you will be required to introduce your research to your fellow classmates in 3 minutes (Oral Presentation Assessment 3). Now, practice introducing your research to a classmate who may or may not be a specialist in your field.

Use the following guiding questions to help you prepare a two-minute speech introducing your research:

1. What is the general field of your research?
2. What is the particular topic within this field that you are interested in?
3. What specific problems or questions are you interested in?
4. Why are these questions/problems important?
5. What is already known about this topic? What is less known?
6. How will you find out more about this topic?
7. What methods of investigation will you use?
8. What are the expected outcomes?
9. What would be the contributions of your research?

Give some feedback to your classmates by commenting on whether the focus of the research is clear to you and whether you think the speech is organised.
