# Theme 7: Academic Language Features - Nominalization

## Doing Things with Nouns (Nominalization)

Nominalization refers to the process of turning a word of another part of speech (usually an adjective or a verb) into a noun. To nominalize a word such as an adjective means to convert it into a noun (e.g. changing *popular* into *popularity*). A nominalized word (e.g. *failure*) is also called a nominalization.

Nominalization is an integral feature of written language and has a few advantages for writers. Nominalization:

- enables the writer to write concisely and formally because it allows information to be packed into a noun-phrase, so that the rest of the clause is available for adding new information. (e.g. *His dedication to the job is known to all his colleagues.*)
- creates a focus on results or processes rather than highlighting the action itself (e.g. *The implementation of the policy improved outcomes.*)
- provides a link between parts of a text. (e.g. *The evaluation of the data led to the identification of key trends.*)
- enables us to categorize, label and describe phenomena. (e.g. *urbanization*, *environmental pollution* and *Internet addiction*)

For the above reasons, it is important for advanced learners of English to learn to nominalize or use nominalizations appropriately in academic writing. (However, it is also important not to overuse nominalizations.)
