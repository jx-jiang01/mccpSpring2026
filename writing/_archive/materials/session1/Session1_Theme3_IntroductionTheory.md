# Theme 3: Introduction Section - Theory & Framework

## INTRODUCTION of a Thesis/Journal Article

A good INTRODUCTION should lead the reader from a general research issue or problem to your specific area of research. It puts your research question in context by explaining the significance of the research being conducted. It should also lay out a roadmap for the rest of the thesis/journal article.

**The main purposes of an introduction are to:**

- draw your readers in (introduces the topic)
- provide background information (briefly mentions some key previous studies)
- convince readers that your work is worth reading (highlight the potential contributions of your work)
- give direction to the remainder of the thesis/journal article (give an outline)

## The CARS Model (Creating a Research Space)

**The Creating a Research Space (CARS) model**, which highlights the key rhetorical moves (organizational patterns) in the introduction of a research paper/thesis, was developed by John Swales (1990) based on his analysis of journal articles representing a variety of discipline-based writing. In this model, there are three main moves:

| Rhetorical Moves                                           | Writing Actions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Move 1: Establishing a Territory [the situation]** | 1. Describe the research problem and provide evidence to support why the topic is important to study.`<br>`2. Explain the current state of knowledge, consensus, practice or description of phenomena.`<br>`3. Synthesise the key prior research that further supports the need to study the research problem; this is different from a literature review in a way that only the key previous studies which have touched upon but not fully addressed the topic are included. |
| **Move 2: Establishing a Niche [the problem]**       | 1. Introduce an opposing viewpoint/perspective to the current state of knowledge; or `<br>`<br />2. Develop the research problem around a gap/an understudied area of the literature; or `<br>`<br />3. Present key questions about the consequences of gaps in prior research that will be addressed by your study; or `<br>`<br />4. Extend prior research to expand upon or clarify a research problem.                                                                  |
| **Move 3: Occupying the Niche [the solution]**       | 1. Explain clearly the objectives of your study.`<br>`2. Present a brief summary of the key findings of your study.`<br>`<br />3. Indicate how the remainder of the paper is organized.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

## Claiming Centrality of Your Research Topic

Research articles and thesis introductions always begin with centrality statements because they help 'establish the general territory' [Move 1 in the CARS model] of the research topic. A centrality statement basically makes a general claim that your research topic area is of central interest or importance in the field, or sometimes in the world at large. These claims have four main features:

1. Characterised by the use of evaluative adjectives e.g. valuable, central, major, important
2. Referring to the impacts and a growing awareness of a problem e.g. increasingly, growing, a classic problem
3. Showing the currency of the topic e.g. current, recent, recently
4. Using an inversion pattern e.g. Particularly noteworthy/significant is that…, Of great/common concern is that…
5. Stated in present/present perfect tense

**Some examples of centrality statements:**

- Recently, there has been a wide interest in…
- The study of…has become an important aspect of…
- The relationship between…has been studied by many researchers in the field.

## Activities & Tasks

### Task 2

**Functions, Key Component and Language Features of an 'INTRODUCTION'**

This task aims to check your prior knowledge about writing an effective introduction of a thesis/journal article in your discipline. Get a partner and discuss the 'functions', 'key components', 'structure' and the 'language features' of the introduction of a thesis/journal article in your discipline. Put your ideas in the space provided in the table below.

If your partner is from a different discipline, find out the possible variations across disciplines.

### The 'Introduction' of a THESIS / JOURNAL ARTICLE

| Functions | Key Components and Structure | Language Features (e.g. tenses, voices, use of technical terms or keywords) |
| --------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|           |                              |                                                                             |

**Questions for further discussion:**

1. What are the possible disciplinary variations in the content (e.g. the key components), structure (e.g. length, number of moves), and language features (e.g. tenses, active vs passive voice, use of technical jargon) of the introduction of a thesis/journal article?
2. Are there any possible differences between the introduction of a thesis and of a journal article in your own discipline?

### Task 3

Read the two excerpts below which are extracted from the introductions of two academic journal articles (in the fields of Chemistry and Social Sciences). Discuss the following questions with a partner:

1. Can you identify the centrality statements in the excerpts? How did the authors establish the general territory of the research topic?

**Excerpt 1**

**INTRODUCTION**
Organic electronics have drawn enormous attention in the past few decades owing to the ease of processing, ultralow-cost substrates, lightweight properties, thin film flexibility and tunable functionality.¹ Integration of photochromic properties with organic electronics has been a tempting approach to accomplish photo-responsive multifunctional optoelectronics.² Several pioneering projects that focused on the development of organic electronics embedded with photochromic layers have brought photochromic materials much closer to having real electronic applications in the foreseeable future.³ In fact, thermal irreversibility and fatigue resistance are especially desirable prerequisites regarding the long-term stability and photo-switching cyclability of photochromic materials for optoelectronic applications. Solid state of thin film photochromic properties are essential for the practical application of photo-responsive optoelectronics. In contrast to crystalline photochromism, which has been well-studied for potential applications in light-driven molecular machines,⁴ thin film photochromism adopted in photo-modulated organic electronics has not been comprehensively investigated for its photochromic properties.

**Excerpt 2**

**INTRODUCTION**
A considerable amount of literature has analysed how the transition to retirement affects subjective well-being (SWB). Older research has reported contradictory results, with no clear findings as to whether retirement had a positive, negative or no general effect on SWB (e.g., Gall et al., 1997; Isaksson & Johansson, 2000; Richardson and Kilty, 1991; Warr et al., 2004). Evidence from more recent studies has highlighted that trajectories of SWB in the post-retirement phase of life show no single universal pattern. Instead, SWB post-retirement depends on a number of protective- and risk-factors that vary across social groups and individuals (e.g., Bender, 2012; Calvo et al., 2009; Pinquart and Schindler, 2007; van Solinge and Henkens, 2005, 2007, 2008; Wang, 2007; Wetzel et al., 2016). Specifically, influencing factors such as economic, social and personal resources (e.g., socio-economic status, marital status, health) as well as the situational context in which retirement takes place (e.g., timing and voluntariness of retirement) can enhance or hamper SWB in the post-work phase of life (van Solinge, 2013).

2. Can you come up with one or two centrality statements for your own thesis topic? You can use the academic phrasebank ([http://www.phrasebank.manchester.ac.uk/introducing-work/](http://www.phrasebank.manchester.ac.uk/introducing-work/)) and ChatGPT to help you. After you finish, show your centrality statements to a partner and get comments.

3. Ask ChatGPT for some comments on your centrality statements. You may input prompts such as:

> "My research is about… (your research focus). I am writing centrality statements to highlight the importance of the research topic in the field of … (your research field). Can you suggest how the following centrality statements can be improved?"

---

**What are some common phrases and language features used in centrality statements?**

---

> **Note:** Although ChatGPT is a useful tool, it may not always give you reliable and accurate information. You need to use your own critical judgement to evaluate ChatGPT's responses. Additionally, you should not ask ChatGPT to write your centrality statements because you understand the importance and novelty of your research topic much better than ChatGPT does.
