## **RECOMMENDATION SUMMARY**

**For Flipped Classroom Model:** Use **OPTION 2** (By Content Type)
- Clear separation of theory (pre-class) and activities (in-class)
- Easy to assign pre-reading
- Activities can be printed separately for class

**For Traditional Lecture:** Use **OPTION 1** (By Learning Sequence)
- Follows natural learning progression
- Each chunk builds on previous knowledge
- Can be delivered sequentially

**For Skill-Based Approach:** Use **OPTION 3** (By Skill Focus)
- Aligns with specific learning outcomes
- Easy to reference specific skills
- Good for targeted practice

**For Single Session:** Use **OPTION 4** (By Session Flow)
- Clear pre/during/post class organization
- Supports flipped classroom model
- Easy to manage workload

---

## **File Naming Convention Suggestion**

If splitting, consider this naming pattern:
- `Session1_Part1_[Topic].md`
- `Session1_Part2_[Topic].md`
- etc.

Or:
- `Session1_Theory.md`
- `Session1_Activities.md`
- `Session1_Examples.md`
- `Session1_Resources.md`

## **Additional Considerations**

1. **Image References:** Ensure image paths are maintained when splitting (e.g., `../image/Session1_Handout_STUDENTversion_LLM_Formatted/1769163746157.png`)

2. **Cross-References:** If tasks reference earlier content, consider:
   - Adding brief summaries in later chunks
   - Using hyperlinks between documents
   - Keeping a master index document

3. **Page Numbers:** Consider removing "Page X" markers or converting them to section numbers for better navigation

4. **Task Continuity:** Some tasks build on previous ones (e.g., Task 5 references Task 4). Keep related tasks together or provide context when separated.
