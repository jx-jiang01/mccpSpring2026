# Theme 8: Independent Learning & Resources

## Independent Language Learning

As a postgraduate student, you need to be able to enhance your academic reading, writing, speaking, listening and research skills independently. To do this systematically, it would be useful if you:

1. set language learning goals for yourself (i.e. identify one or two language areas that you would like to improve)
2. select relevant learning materials and methods from the Independent Language Learning Guide (available on Moodle)
3. carry out the independent language learning activities
4. regularly monitor and reflect on your own learning progress

In this course, there will be an individual consultation in which you can discuss your language learning plans and/or the problems you encountered in the independent language learning process with your lecturer. The Language Centre is also providing a range of language learning support services to HKBU students. Please ask your lecturer for more details.

## Planning, Monitoring, and Reflecting

An effective independent language learner should be able to plan, monitor and reflect on their own learning:
