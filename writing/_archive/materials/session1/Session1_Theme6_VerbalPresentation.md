# Theme 6: Verbal Presentation Skills

## Introducing Your Research Verbally

Postgraduate students have many opportunities to introduce their research verbally to specialist or non-specialist audiences in different contexts e.g. academic conferences, candidature confirmation seminars, oral defences (viva), departmental seminars, round-table discussions, lab meetings with thesis supervisors and fellow research postgraduate students, 3-minute thesis competitions. Therefore, it is important for you to be able to verbally introduce your research to others in a concise and organised way.

When introducing your research to others, you need to consider the audience (Is s/he a specialist or non-specialist in your field? What does s/he want to know about your research?), purpose (Is the purpose of the speech to inform/persuade/inspire?), and the structure (How many sections are there? How can you help the audience follow the logical flow of ideas more easily?) of your speech.

At the end of this course, you will be required to introduce your research to your fellow classmates in 3 minutes (Oral Presentation Assessment 3). Now, practice introducing your research to a classmate who may or may not be a specialist in your field.

Use the following guiding questions to help you prepare a two-minute speech introducing your research:

1. What is the general field of your research?
2. What is the particular topic within this field that you are interested in?
3. What specific problems or questions are you interested in?
4. Why are these questions/problems important?
5. What is already known about this topic? What is less known?
6. How will you find out more about this topic?
7. What methods of investigation will you use?
8. What are the expected outcomes?
9. What would be the contributions of your research?

Give some feedback to your classmates by commenting on whether the focus of the research is clear to you and whether you think the speech is organised.
