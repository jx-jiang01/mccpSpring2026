# My Reflection on Writing

## Writing Challenges and Difficulties

**What aspects of academic writing do you find most challenging?**

One of the most challenging aspects of academic writing for me is expressing my ideas in a clear and logical manner. I often struggle to organize my thoughts coherently, which sometimes makes my arguments difficult to follow. Additionally, I find it hard to use precise vocabulary and appropriate transitions to connect my points smoothly, resulting in my writing lacking clarity and flow.

**What specific difficulties do you face when writing Introduction/Literature Review?**

Sometimes, I find it difficult to summarize the background from a broad, high-level perspective. I tend to focus too much on specific details instead of providing an overall context, which makes it challenging to present a clear and comprehensive introduction or literature review.

**What do you struggle with most?**

When I write a long paper, I find it difficult to manage all the content effectively. For example, I sometimes forget what I have written in earlier sections while working on the current part, which can make my paper less logical and coherent as a whole.

## My Writing Process

**How do you approach writing Introduction and Literature Review?**

My approach to writing the Introduction and Literature Review consists of several steps. First, I think carefully about the main content I want to include.

Then, I fill in the outline by writing the actual content, making sure to cover all the key points. 
Finally, I revise the draft several times to improve clarity, coherence, and academic quality.


**What steps do you take?**
1. Develop an outline to organize my main ideas.
2. Write and expand on each section according to the outline.
