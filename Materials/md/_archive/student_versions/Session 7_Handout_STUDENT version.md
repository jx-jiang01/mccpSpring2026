Drawing Conclusions and Highlighting Significance of the Research
Giving an Academic Presentation (Poster Presentation Skills)

### Learning Outcomes:
By the end of this session, students should be able to:
- write the Conclusion section with appropriate organizational structure and linguistic resources
- highlight the significance of the research using appropriate expressions and rhetorical strategies 
- engage their audience through telling compelling research story, maintaining eye contact, and providing thoughtful responses during poster presentations
- design visually appealing posters that enhance understanding, utilizing principles of layout, color, and typography

### Writing the Conclusion section
The conclusion section of a research paper is a crucial component that ties together the main findings and implications of your work. It serves as the final opportunity to reinforce your research's significance, offering a concise summary of key insights and their relevance to the field. A well-crafted conclusion not only synthesizes the main arguments but also highlights the broader impact of your research, suggesting avenues for future study and inviting further exploration of the topic. Mastering this section enhances the overall coherence of your paper and leaves a lasting impression on your readers.

**Warm-up Task**
Find a partner and discuss the following questions.
1. What are the functions of the Conclusion section of a thesis and a journal article?

**Task 1**
Read and comment on the following two examples of the Conclusion section. Are they effective? Why/why not?

The abstracts below give you some ideas about the research.

### Example 1:
**Abstract**
This article provides an overview of language learning strategies (LLS) for second and foreign language (L2/FL) teachers. To do so it outlines the background of LLS and LLS training, discusses a three step approach teachers may follow in using LLS in their classes, and summarises key reflections and questions for future research on this aspect of L2/FL education.

**Conclusion**
This paper has provided a brief overview of LLS by examining their background and summarising the relevant literature. It has also outlined some ways that LLS training has been used and offered a three step approach for teachers to consider in implementing it within their own L2/FL classes. It has also raised two important issues, posed questions for further LLS research, and noted a number of contacts that readers may use in networking on LLS in L2/FL education. In my experience, using LLS and LLS training in the L2/FL class not only encourages learners in their language learning but also helps teachers reflect on and improve their teaching. Many readers also find this to be the case.
