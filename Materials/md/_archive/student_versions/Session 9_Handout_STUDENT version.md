### Session 9
### Giving a Three-minute Thesis Presentation

**Learning Outcomes:**
By the end of this session, students should be able to:
- use word stress and intonation to convey meaning effectively in academic presentations
- design, use and explain visuals effectively in academic presentations
- give a three-minute thesis presentation highlighting the significance of their research

**Task 1**
Watch the following video from 0:00-1:45 to see why stress and intonation are so important.
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nYpA2UgV0s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nYpA2UgV0s)

While watching the video, take notes for the following questions:
1. What is stress? What is intonation?
2. Which words in a sentence are often stressed?
3. What is the most important thing in achieving good intonation?
4. Without proper stress and intonation when you talk, how will your listeners feel?

**Task 2**
Watch the first two minutes of the following presentation video. How do you think the speaker has used stress and intonation effectively to convey meaning?

Hany Farid: How to spot fake AI photos | TED Talk

1. Identify some examples of stressed words in the talk.

2. Why do you think the speaker stresses these words? What characteristics do these words share?
3. In what ways do stress and intonation enhance the meaning conveyed during the talk?

### Giving a Three-Minute-Thesis Presentation

In a Three-Minute Thesis (3MT) presentation, effectively communicating your research story is essential for engaging your audience and conveying the significance of your work. This skill involves distilling complex ideas into clear, concise narratives that highlight key findings and their implications. Postgraduates must learn to structure their presentations logically, employing skills such as creating a strong opening hook to capture attention, using vivid language and relatable examples to clarify concepts, and incorporating visual aids to enhance understanding. Additionally, mastering body language and vocal variety can help maintain audience interest. By honing these skills, researchers can make their presentations more compelling and accessible, ultimately inspiring interest and dialogue around their work.

**Task 3**
Watch a three-minute thesis video from the Graduate School, Stony Brook University: SBU Three Minute Thesis 2019: Olivia Swanson, 1st Place - YouTube

Use the following questions to help you analyze the video:
1. How does the speaker organize the talk (read the transcript on the next page)? What are the key moves?
2. What strategies does the speaker use to explain abstract or technical concepts?
3. What do you notice about the body language used by the speaker?
4. What do you notice about the style/tone of a 3MT presentation?

5. What do you think about the delivery skills of the speaker? What makes her a successful speaker?
6. What transitional/signal phrases are used to connect ideas? Are they natural and economic (time-saving)?

### Brain in Motion

There's so many things that we take for granted each day. Let's consider a simple sip of that essential morning coffee as your hand reaches for the mug and brings it to your mouth, you're not considering all the muscle contractions that allow you to do this, nor do you notice that while you drink your coffee, the rest of your body is remaining still behind the scenes. Our brains are working really hard to make sure this all goes smoothly. But what if, day by day, our brains were no longer able to direct us in our intended movements, and instead started signaling our bodies to move in all sorts of unintended ways? This is the reality for many people with Parkinson's disease.

Parkinson's disease causes symptoms like uncontrollable shaking hands, difficulty walking and speaking and constantly clenched muscles. And what scientists know is that the cause of Parkinson's Disease is a loss of a brain chemical called dopamine. And while we're pretty sure that dopamine helps brain cells communicate properly with one another. How exactly it does this job across the brain is still unclear. So that's where people like me come in.

I study Parkinson's disease in an area of the brain called the motor cortex. So why is the motor cortex special? Well, for any given movement like grasping that coffee mug, it requires coordinated communication across many brain areas, but the motor cortex is the last of these brain areas to receive the so called Move signal before it leaves your brain and travels to the rest of your body. You can think of the motor cortex as a metaphorical funnel in this way. Iit needs to allow just the right balance of move signals through. So my goal is to understand how dopamine plays a role in this communication within the motor cortex.

So the way I study this is in a simulated Parkinson's disease in a mouse, and in this way, I'm able to look at the brain at a much higher level of detail than I would be able to in an actual Parkinson's patient. My work involves listening in on the communications of brain cells in the motor cortex. I listen to the move signals they receive and how they respond.

And what my results have shown is that dopamine acts as the neck of this metaphorical funnel. It can completely control how a cell in the motor cortex responds, the magnitude of its response. And furthermore, when a brain is depleted of dopamine, suddenly the neck widens and more mood signals are allowed through, and we find that more signals are leaving the motor cortex, which might be contributing to those uncontrollable symptoms that I mentioned earlier.

So the next step would be finding a way to correct for this improper communication before real problems start to occur. So my hope is that my work is a piece of the larger puzzle of this disorder,

and with each advancement in knowledge, we're able to better support those with Parkinson's disease and work towards a cure. Thank you.

**Task 4**
Find a 3MT presentation video in your field of study (e.g., on YouTube or the University of Queensland's 3MT website: Three Minute Thesis - University of Queensland). Analyze the presentation using the guiding questions in Task 3.

**Task 5**
Now plan for your own 3MT presentation using the template below.

| Section | Content |
|---------|----------|
| Opening - Hook | |
| Research Motivation | |
| Research Objectives | |
| Brief Mention of Research Methodology | |
| Key Findings/Preliminary Findings/Expected Outcomes | |
| Significance of the Research (i.e. originality), Applications of the Research Findings | |

Practice the opening of your 3MT presentation with a partner. You may use ChatGPT to help you brainstorm ideas for ways to engage your audience or explain the scientific/technical concepts to the audience.
