# Archived Student Version Markdown Files

These student version markdown files were archived because they contain mostly empty/incomplete content from the PDF conversion process.

## Files Archived
- Session 1_Handout_STUDENT version.md (86 lines - mostly empty, only page 19 fragment)
- Session 2_Handout_STUDENT Version.md (104 lines - mostly empty, only page 17 fragment)
- Session 3_Handout_STUDENT version.md
- Session 4_Handout_STUDENT version.md
- Session 7_Handout_STUDENT version.md
- Session 8_Handout_STUDENT version.md
- Session 9_Handout_STUDENT version.md

## Reason for Archiving
These files were generated from PDF conversion and contain very little actual content - mostly just image references and fragments. The Word document versions (with `_word` suffix) contain complete, properly formatted content and should be used instead.
