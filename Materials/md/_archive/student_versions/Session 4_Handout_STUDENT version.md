**Learning Outcomes:**
By the end of this session, students should be able to:

**Task 1**
Academic conferences offer research postgraduates the opportunity to present ongoing work and discuss their research with peers and scholars in the field. How much do you know about the academic conferences in your field? What preparation work do you need to do before presenting your research at a conference? Discuss the following questions with a partner:

1. Conduct an online search for an academic conference that you might be interested in attending. What are the types of presentations for the conference?
2. What are the guidelines for preparing an abstract/a full paper as stated on the conference website?
3. What preparation work is needed for a conference presentation?
4. What do you need to consider when preparing the content of a conference presentation?

For more information and tips on presenting at conferences, check out the e-book "Presenting your research: conferences, symposiums, poster presentations and beyond" by Becker, L. (2014) which is available on HKBU Library website.
