Step 3: Write paragraphs with topic sentences
When writing a synthesis, each paragraph should discuss a few different sources, and you should be able to condense the overall point of the paragraph into one sentence which is called the topic sentence. The topic sentence signals what the whole paragraph is about; every sentence in the paragraph should be clearly related to it. For an effective synthesis, you can use topic sentences to link back to the previous paragraph or highlight a point of debate or critique. By using topic sentences, you can ensure that your paragraphs are coherent and clearly show the connections between the articles you are discussing.

Step 4: Revise, edit and proofread the synthesis
After writing the synthesis, you can use the following checklist to evaluate your synthesis:
- Is there a clear and focused topic sentence outlining what the paragraph is about?
- Is the paragraph organized around one single idea?
- Has the synthesis discussed multiple sources?
- Are the similarities and differences between the sources highlighted?
- Is the synthesis written in your own words?
- Is the synthesis directly relevant to your research question or topic?
- Is there a logical transition between sentences and between paragraphs?
- Are the sources cited correctly using the correct referencing style and conventions?

**Task 5**: Choose three research articles you have read recently and identify the common points between them. Write a synthesis (no more than 80 words) of the information from the three sources. You may focus on the methods, results or implications. After you finished, show your synthesis to a classmate. Use the checklist above (in step 4) to evaluate the synthesis.
