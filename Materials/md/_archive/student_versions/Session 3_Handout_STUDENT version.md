The diagram below shows how a particular view of the world reflects the whole research process. By setting out the interrelationship between what researchers think can be analyzed (ontological position), linking it to what researchers can actually know about it (epistemological position) and how to go about acquiring it, it is possible to comprehend the impact on what or how you decide to study the problem. However, it is important to note that ultimately you need to identify the research strategy that best meets your research objectives.

The Directional Relationship between Key Components (the building blocks) of Research

| Ontology | Epistemology | Methodology | Method | Sources |
|----------|--------------|--------------|---------|----------|
| What is out there to know? | What and how can we know about it? | How can we go about acquiring that knowledge? | What precise procedures can we use to acquire it? | What data can we collect? |

Methodology vs. Methods

Methodology refers to a theory or framework in which the researcher is taking (e.g. quantitative or qualitative), and the argument that is given to justify choices made in the theory as well as the specific method(s) selected. It requires a clear explanation and rationale. Some parts are quite theoretical or academic (making reference to other studies or books/articles on research methods), while other parts are more practical (how to).

Method(s) refers to actual research instruments and participants/materials used (e.g. interviews or discourse analysis, lab equipment, statistics, etc.). Writers need to justify why each method was chosen, and not others (justify choices using the literature).
