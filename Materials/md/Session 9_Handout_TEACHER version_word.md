# MCCP6020 ADVANCED ENGLISH FOR ACADEMIC PURPOSES SESSION 9
---


**Learning Outcomes:**
By the end of this session, students should be able to:
- use word stress and intonation to convey meaning effectively in academic presentations
- design and use visual aids effectively in academic presentations
- give a three-minute thesis presentation highlighting the significance of their research
Watch the following video from 0:00-2:08 to see why they are so important. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nYpA2UgV0s
While watching the video, take notes for the following questions:
- What is stress? What is intonation?
Stress is the emphasis given to a syllable in a word or words within a sentence and usually involves an increase in volume and a change in intonation.
Intonation is the way the voice goes up or down.
- Which words in a sentence are often stressed?
While speaking stress and intonation are used to make the important content of your talk clear. Often there is a rise in intonation on a keyword, but sometimes there is a fall especially at the end of sentences.
- What is the most important thing in achieving good intonation?
The important thing is that there is a contrast in intonation with the words that surround the one you want to stress.
- Without proper stress and intonation when you talk, how will your listeners feel?
Without appropriate stress and intonation, your listeners may miss the point you're trying to make. What’s worse, you may end up sounding like a robot.
Watch the first two minutes of the following presentation video. How do you think the speaker has used stress and intonation effectively to convey meaning?

- Identify some examples of stressed words in the talk.
- Why do you think the speaker stresses these words? What characteristics do these words share?
Those words carry important meaning, helping listeners grasp the main ideas.
- In what ways do stress and intonation enhance the meaning conveyed during the talk?
- Clarifying meaning, expressing emotions and attitudes, maintaining listener interest, signaling confidence and control, organizing information
Giving a Three-Minute-Thesis Presentation
In a Three-Minute Thesis (3MT) presentation, effectively communicating your research story is essential for engaging your audience and conveying the significance of your work. This skill involves distilling complex ideas into clear, concise narratives that highlight key findings and their implications. Postgraduates must learn to structure their presentations logically, employing skills such as creating a strong opening hook to capture attention, using vivid language and relatable examples to clarify concepts, and incorporating visual aids to enhance understanding. Additionally, mastering body language and vocal variety can help maintain audience interest. By honing these skills, researchers can make their presentations more compelling and accessible, ultimately inspiring interest and dialogue around their work.

Use the following questions to help you analyze the video:
- How does the speaker organize the talk (read the transcript on the next page)? What are the key moves?
- What strategies does the speaker use to explain abstract or technical concepts?
- What do you notice about the body language used by the speaker?
- What do you notice about the style/tone of a 3MT presentation?
- What do you think about the delivery skills of the speaker? What makes her a successful speaker?
- What transitional/signal phrases are used to connect ideas? Are they natural and economic (time-saving)?

Brain in Motion
There's so many things that we take for granted each day. Let's consider a simple sip of that essential morning coffee as your hand reaches for the mug and brings it to your mouth, you're not considering all the muscle contractions that allow you to do this, nor do you notice that while you drink your coffee, the rest of your body is remaining still behind the scenes. Our brains are working really hard to make sure this all goes smoothly. But what if, day by day, our brains were no longer able to direct us in our intended movements, and instead started signaling our bodies to move in all sorts of unintended ways? This is the reality for many people with Parkinson's disease.
Parkinson's disease causes symptoms like uncontrollable shaking hands, difficulty walking and speaking and constantly clenched muscles. And what scientists know is that the cause of Parkinson's Disease is a loss of a brain chemical called dopamine. And while we're pretty sure that dopamine helps brain cells communicate properly with one another. How exactly it does this job across the brain is still unclear. So that's where people like me come in.
I study Parkinson's disease in an area of the brain called the motor cortex. So why is the motor cortex special? Well, for any given movement like grasping that coffee mug, it requires coordinated communication across many brain areas, but the motor cortex is the last of these brain areas to receive the so called Move signal before it leaves your brain and travels to the rest of your body. You can think of the motor cortex as a metaphorical funnel in this way. Iit needs to allow just the right balance of move signals through. So my goal is to understand how dopamine plays a role in this communication within the motor cortex.
So the way I study this is in a simulated Parkinson's disease in a mouse, and in this way, I'm able to look at the brain at a much higher level of detail than I would be able to in an actual Parkinson's patient. My work involves listening in on the communications of brain cells in the motor cortex. I listen to the move signals they receive and how they respond.
And what my results have shown is that dopamine acts as the neck of this metaphorical funnel. It can completely control how a cell in the motor cortex responds, the magnitude of its response. And furthermore, when a brain is depleted of dopamine, suddenly the neck widens and more mood signals are allowed through, and we find that more signals are leaving the motor cortex, which might be contributing to those uncontrollable symptoms that I mentioned earlier.
So the next step would be finding a way to correct for this improper communication before real problems start to occur. So my hope is that my work is a piece of the larger puzzle of this disorder, and with each advancement in knowledge, we're able to better support those with Parkinson's disease and work towards a cure. Thank you.
Find a 3MT presentation video in your field of study (e.g., on YouTube or the University of Queensland's 3MT website: Three Minute Thesis - University of Queensland). Analyze the presentation using the guiding questions in Task 3.
Notes to Teachers: You may select a 3MT video relevant to your students’ discipline(s) and analyze it with your students. Alternatively, you may ask your students to select and analyze a 3MT video which they find interesting.

Suggestions to students:
Organisation of 3MT presentations:
Five typical moves: orientation, rationale, purpose, methods and results (Jiang & Qiu, 2022)
Introduces the topic – grabbing the audience’s attention by providing surprising data, showing a visual, asking rhetorical questions, emphasizing the importance of the topic, etc.
Explains what is still unknown (the research/knowledge gap)
Explains the focus/objectives of your research
Briefly explains the methodology (if possible) and the preliminary results (if any)
Emphasises the potential contribution and the significance of the research.
Style/Tone of 3MT presentations:
A highly frequent use of first and second person pronouns ‘I’ and ‘you’ in 3MT presentations.
It’s appropriate to use rhetorical questions to interact with the audience
It's important to use stress and intonation and hand gesture effectively to convey messages
“Hard sciences make more use of stance expressions, especially attitude markers which highlight the importance and surprise value of research findings, because research subjects in sciences are typically abstract beyond a common sense of nature and this heightened persuasive interaction oils the wheels of communicating scientific knowledge to a wide audience. In contrast, the fluid and disputable nature of soft knowledge necessitates dialogic involvement, so presenters in the soft disciplines posed more rhetorical questions” (Qiu & Jiang, 2021).
Advice on 3MT preparation: https://threeminutethesis.uq.edu.au/resources/3mt-competitor-guide
In Qiu and Jiang’s (2021) research, it was found that four stance resources are used to express “an attitudinal dimension” (how 3MT presenters project themselves and convey their judgments, opinions and commitments):
Hedges allow speakers to withhold complete commitment to a proposition and open a discursive space with listeners’ disputation, such as might and could.
Boosters help speakers present their work with assurance and shut down alternative voices, such as in fact and must.
Attitude markers express speakers’ affective attitudes to propositions, conveying surprise, agreement, appreciation and so on, such as good and fascinating.
Self mention marks speakers’ overt visibility and ownership to their contributions, such as I and my.
In addition, four categories of engagement are examined for the ways presenters rhetorically focus the listeners’ attention and pull them along with their argument:
Listener mention brings listeners into the on-going speech, normally through second person pronouns and inclusive first-person pronouns, such as you and your.
Directives are instructions to the listeners, mainly expressed through imperatives and obligation modals, such as consider and it’s important to note.
Questions invite direct collusion by addressing the listeners as having an interest in an issue and a willingness to follow the speakers’ argument, such as And may I ask you a question?
Appeals to shared knowledge are signals asking listeners to recognize something as familiar or accepted, such as obviously and normally.
